# satellite-boat-spotting


This contains the code used for finding leusire boats around Oslo, Bergen and Fredrikstad. 


The data is not available here, but you can contact me here to request them. They might only be given to organizations that have an agreement with Geonorge/Kartverket/Norgeibilder.no. This is because I'm unsure if I'm allowed to share it, as I do not own the data.


More updates to this README might follow.
